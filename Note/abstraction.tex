    This note presents and simulates the low temperature limit calculation of quantum harmonic oscillator. By performing Wick rotation, the project derived the density matrix of the harmonic oscillator with Feynman path integral. By Monte Carlo simulation with Metropolis algorithm, the project calculates the distribution of the energy of the ground state. The theoretical prediction and simulation are aligned well.
